								<b>About Me:</b>
							</p> Snooping around in the private lives of galaxies has been a desire of mine for as long as I've known that the universe was home 
							to more than just the Milky Way. The pursuit of this passion was put on hold when at 15 I found myself needing to focus on a more 
							immediate desire of escaping houselessness and putting a roof over my head. During this period of my life I had many adventures -- 
							including playing in bands, pretending to be an artist, and falling in love.
							<br> My return to school was well timed. 
							There have been many advances in our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve over the last several years. 
							With these advances come new techniques which allow us to reconstruct what a galaxy has been up to with nothing but the light we observe. 
							It's beyond thrilling to get to contribute to this body of work.
							<br>My specialization lies in looking at the environmental dependence of star formation in galaxies based on their star formation histories. 
							I'm particularly interested in the temporal and spatial relationship of star formation within galaxies in spatially resolved observations, 
							as well as between galaxies that are in groups or pairs.

								Much of my work exists at the border of where our instruments can resolve features within galaxies. 
								This allows for important validation of high redshift techniques on nearby and nearby low mass galaxies, 
								but also enables the development of 
								new methods that allow us to push deeper into the semi-resolved universe. 
								Bonus is that we can learn new things about our near-ish neighbors. 
								What I'm most interested in is how individual galaxies grow their stellar mass over time, 
								and how much impact their external and internal environment impacts this. The low redshift universe grants us access to some of the smallest, faintest, 
								and most plentiful galaxies. These small galaxies are the most sensitive to environment and therefore promise to tell us the most about how environment drives galaxy evolution.

								<b>SEDs and CMDs Find Synchronized Star Formation in Local Volume Dwarf Galaxies</b><br>There are two main ways of reconstructing 
								a galaxy's star formation history (SFH). If it is nearby, you can look at the color and brightness of its stars and infer the ages of 
								its stellar populations. If it is far away you can sum up 
								the total flux through bands at different wavelengths and then fit the galaxy's spectrum and infer the populations that 
								contribute to it's total light. The first is the color-magnitude diagram method of SFR reconstruction and the second is the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting method. 
								I do the second one, but seeing how the two compare is an important validation! 
								We took galaxies that were close enough to resolve individual stars, yet far away enough to have reliable integrated photometry 
								and compared their SFHs. Not only did these compare well, but we found that the SFHs of the galaxies in our sample 
								decreased and increased their star formation 
								synchronistically at specific epochs in spite of being separated by great distances!! 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Looking for confformity in Local Volume galaxies </b><br>
								Galactic conformity refers to shared property between pairs of galaxies. For example, the average color or SFR of galaxies near
								a central galaxy may be similar to the properties of that central galaxy. These types or tests are usually performed on large populations
								to find in-situ trends in galaxy evolution. We investigated whether the galaxies having synchronized star formation might also show conformity. 
								Using the SFHs of the galaxies allowed us to read the properties off the SFHs at different epochs. We did find conformity, but not in 
								the galaxies showing synchronized star formation, which suggests that synchronized star formation and conformity are sensitive to different effects.
								Additionally we saw that the conformity signal was sensitive to the geometry of the volume. Using SFHs to test for conformity gives us a promising
								new way to test for interactions back in time within a volume.
